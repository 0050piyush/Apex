# Javascript
JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for creating interactive effects within web browsers. It's a high-level, interpreted scripting language that allows developers to add dynamic behavior to web pages. Here's a brief overview of JavaScript and some of its keywords:

1. **Variables**: Variables are used to store data values. In JavaScript, you declare a variable using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keyword.

   ```javascript
   var x = 10;
   let y = 20;
   const PI = 3.14;
   ```

2. **Functions**: Functions are blocks of code that can be defined and then called later. They can take parameters and return values.

   ```javascript
   function add(a, b) {
       return a + b;
   }
   ```

3. **Conditional Statements**: Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. Keywords include `if`, `else if`, and `else`.

   ```javascript
   var age = 18;
   if (age >= 18) {
       console.log("You are an adult.");
   } else {
       console.log("You are a minor.");
   }
   ```

4. **Loops**: Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times. Keywords include `for`, `while`, and `do...while`.

   ```javascript
   for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
       console.log(i);
   }
   ```

5. **Objects**: JavaScript is an object-oriented language, and objects are one of its fundamental data types. Objects can contain properties and methods.

   ```javascript
   var person = {
       firstName: "John",
       lastName: "Doe",
       age: 30,
       fullName: function() {
           return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
       }
   };
   ```

6. **Arrays**: Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. 

   ```javascript
   var fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];
   ```

7. **Event Handling**: JavaScript is commonly used for handling user interactions. Events are actions that occur within the browser window, like clicks or keystrokes.

   ```javascript
   document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
       alert("Button clicked!");
   });
   ```

These are just a few examples of JavaScript keywords and concepts. JavaScript is a powerful language with many more features and capabilities.
